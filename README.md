# sine-wave-animations
This repository contains animated visualizations of a sine wave created using Manim and Matplotlib. The animations demonstrate how mathematical concepts can be brought to life through Python programming. Both a Manim-based video and a Matplotlib animation (saved as .mp4 or .gif) are included.
Sine Wave Animations
This repository contains animated visualizations of a sine wave using Python. The animations are implemented with two powerful visualization libraries: Manim (for high-quality mathematical animations) and Matplotlib (for basic motion visualizations). The repository includes both the code and the output animation files.

Features
Manim Animation: A high-quality mathematical animation that plots a sine wave and animates a dot moving along the wave.
Matplotlib Animation: A lightweight animation of a sine wave with a moving dot, saved as .mp4 and .gif.
Preview
Manim Animation (SineWave.mp4)
A sine wave animation with a dot moving along the wave path.


Matplotlib Animation (sine_wave_animation.gif)
A sine wave animation created with Matplotlib.


Getting Started
To reproduce the animations locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Youâ€™ll also need the following libraries:

Manim: For mathematical animations
Matplotlib: For general-purpose visualizations
NumPy: For numerical operations
