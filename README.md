# sine-wave-animations
This repository contains animated visualizations of a sine wave created using Manim and Matplotlib. The animations demonstrate how mathematical concepts can be brought to life through Python programming. Both a Manim-based video and a Matplotlib animation (saved as .mp4 or .gif) are included.
